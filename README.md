# Inkscape Extension For Subdiving Paths<br>
This extension lets the user subdivide paths into new paths. <br>
It's similar to the prebuilt 'Add Node' extension, with the additional ability to choose subdivision unit <br>
and to create new path objects from the subdivided segments.<br>
The new path xml Ids are inherited from the source path.<br><br>

# Installation
Copy <i>split_bezier.py</i> and <i>split_bezier.inx</i> in the user extension folder. The extension folder can be found from Edit->Preference dialog in the System option. You will need to restart inkscape after the files are copied.<br>

# Usage
The 'Subdivide Path' effect is under Extensions->Modify Path menu. You can choose multiple paths and invokde the extension. Selecting the 'Break Apart' check box will create new paths from the subdivided segments.
